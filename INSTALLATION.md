#How to Run the TravelCompanion App


This project has a CSV file, which has to be loaded via a server due to browser security restrictions. Opening `login.html` directly (via double-click) on a web server
**wonâ€™t work** due to inability to access the CSV file contents.

## How to Run Using Live Server (Required for CSV Access)

To run the app properly and load the CSV file:

**1. Install Visual Studio Code (if not already):**
   [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

   - Open VS Code
   - Go to the Extensions tab
   - Search for **Live Server** and install it.

**3. Open the project folder** in VS Code:**

   code .

**4. Go to login.html and select:**
   **"Open With Live Server**"
