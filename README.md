##  Team Outlook

Create an app to centralize all relevant travel information specific to cities. The app will provide:

- Stores/Businesses
- Best food spots 
- Hotels and Airbnb's
- Local attractions
- Real-time Weather
- Real-time communication and updates from users who have checked in

---

## Problem Statement

- Travelers often rely on multiple apps for trip planning.
- Existing apps focus on single features (navigation, hotels, etc.).
- Gathering complete travel info is inefficient and time-consuming.
- No platform offers **real-time updates** for closures, price changes, or local tips.
- This leads to missed opportunities and a frustrating travel experience.

---

##  Our Solution

A **single travel app** combining everything a traveler needs:

- Everything relevant to a traveler, locally.
- Real-time updates and feedback from other users
- Streamlined UI for easy navigation, planning, and viewing experience.

---

##  Target Audience

- **Primary**: Travelers seeking organized, relevant trip data.
- **Secondary**: Locals sharing recommendations, backpackers, and business travelers needing quick insights.

##  Tech Stack

- **Backend**: JavaScript  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database**: LocalStorage  
- **Hosting**: 
- **Tools**: Git  
- **Platforms**: Mobile & Desktop
